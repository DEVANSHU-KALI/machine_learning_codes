I hope you came here after reading about the linear regression.
- here this simple linear regression only models relationship between 1 dependent variable and 1 independent variable.
- other than that all the things are same, from calculating the gradients and updating them and plotting the graph.
- you need to install the numpy and matplotlib library.
- then copy the code to any of your ide or python interpreter and run it, you'll see the final parameters and a graph.
